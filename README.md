Overview (tl;dr)
=========

Brosec is a terminal based reference utility designed to help us infosec bros and broettes with useful (yet sometimes complex) payloads and commands that are often used during work as infosec practitioners. An example of one of Brosec's most popular use cases is the ability to generate on the fly reverse shells (python, perl, powershell, etc) that get copied to the clipboard.

Assuming the user has already set up the required variables (see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/gabemarshall/Brosec/wiki/Getting-Started) section of the wiki) a reverse shell using the awk command can be generated as easy as...

Or maybe you need to remotely invoke a Powershell script? A download cradle can be generated like so.

##### Additional Features and Usage Examples


###### [Bros http(s)](https://github.com/gabemarshall/Brosec/wiki/bros-http)
Need a quick web server? Forget python SimpleHTTPServer, bros has your back with `bros http` when entered via the command line. An SSL server? `bros https` has you covered.

###### [Bros FTP](https://github.com/gabemarshall/Brosec/wiki/bros-ftp)
Need to exfiltrate some data via ftp? Bros comes with a handy `bros ftp` when entered via the command line. The ftp server accepts anonymous downloads/uploads from the CWD (so be careful when running).


###### [Bros Encode](https://github.com/gabemarshall/Brosec/wiki/bros-encode)

A encoder/decoder utility designed with penetration testers in mind that often find the need to encode and decode various payloads.

Brosec was heavily inspired by the Red Team Field Manual by Ben Clark. In addition, many payloads were referenced from other resources and deserve a shoutout.
